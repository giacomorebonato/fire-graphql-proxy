## Instructions  
Clone the repo and execute  
```
npm install  
npm run watch  # TypeScript => JS  
npm start      # Start the server  
```  
And this will start a web server with GraphiQL client on `http://localhost:3000/graphql`.  
On `http://localhost:3000/` you have a basic interface for adding data.
