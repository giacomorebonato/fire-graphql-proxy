Fire-GraphQL is a GraphQL Proxy sample for Firebase.

- Takes advance of Firebase validation/authentication  

## Drawbacks

## Instructions  
Clone the repo and execute  
```
npm install  
npm run watch  # in one window  
npm start      # in another one  
```  
And this will start a web server with GraphiQL client on `http://localhost:3000/graphql`.
